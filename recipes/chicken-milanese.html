    <h2 class="food-header">What is the Chicken Milanese?</h2>
    <p class="food-description">
      Chicken Milanese is an exquisite dish that embodies simplicity and
      elegance in Italian cuisine. It starts with a tender chicken breast,
      pounded thin to ensure even cooking and tenderness. The chicken is then
      coated in a breadcrumb mixture, often seasoned with herbs like parsley and
      grated Parmesan cheese, adding a delightful richness and depth of flavor.
    </p>
    <p class="food-description">
      Next, the chicken is lightly fried in olive oil or butter until the
      coating turns golden brown and crispy, creating a crunchy exterior that
      contrasts beautifully with the juicy, tender meat inside. The frying
      process locks in moisture, ensuring each bite is succulent and flavorful.
    </p>
    <p class="food-description">
      Once perfectly cooked, the Chicken Milanese is typically served with a
      garnish of fresh arugula, dressed in a zesty vinaigrette or simply
      drizzled with lemon juice. This adds a refreshing and peppery element that
      balances the richness of the chicken.
    </p>
    <p class="food-description">
      The dish is often accompanied by lemon wedges, allowing diners to add a
      citrus-like brightness according to their preference. It's a dish that
      harmonizes textures and flavors—crispy and tender, savory and tangy—all
      coming together in a delightful and satisfying culinary experience.

            ><strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong></span
          >
          Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound
          them to an even thickness (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick). Season both
          sides of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.

            ><strong>Set Up the Dredging Station:</strong></span
          >
          In three separate shallow bowls or plates, set up a dredging station.
          Place flour in one, beaten eggs in another, and a mixture of
          breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper in the
          third bowl.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <span class="recipe-li-bold"><strong>Coat the Chicken:</strong></span>
          Dredge each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess. Then
          dip it into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally,
          coat the chicken thoroughly in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently
          to adhere the crumbs.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <span class="recipe-li-bold"><strong>Fry the Chicken:</strong></span>
          Heat a generous amount of olive oil or vegetable oil in a large
          skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the coated chicken
          breasts (you may need to cook them in batches to avoid overcrowding
          the pan). Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side or until golden
          brown and cooked through. Transfer the cooked chicken to a paper
          towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <span class="recipe-li-bold"><strong>Serve:</strong></span> Arrange a
          bed of fresh arugula on plates. Place the Chicken Milanese on top of
          the arugula. Garnish with lemon wedges.
