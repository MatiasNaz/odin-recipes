    <h2 class="food-header">What is the Margherita Pizza?</h2>
    <p class="food-description">
      The Margherita pizza is a culinary masterpiece that epitomizes simplicity
      and elegance in Italian cuisine. At its core, it celebrates the harmony of
      just a few fresh and high-quality ingredients.
    </p>
    <p class="food-description">
      The foundation is a perfectly baked crust—thin, yet with a satisfyingly
      chewy texture. This canvas is adorned with vibrant, sun-ripened tomatoes
      or a simple tomato sauce, delivering a burst of fresh flavor. The tomatoes
      are spread thinly to maintain the pizza's balance, allowing their natural
      sweetness to shine through.
    </p>
    <p class="food-description">
      Next comes the creamy, milky richness of fresh mozzarella cheese,
      carefully arranged in soft, melting dollops or slices across the surface.
      The cheese melds beautifully with the tomatoes, providing a delicate
      contrast to their acidity.
    </p>
    <p class="food-description">
      Completing this culinary artwork are bright green basil leaves, arranged
      atop the cheese. The basil not only adds a visual pop of color but also
      infuses the pizza with its aromatic freshness, releasing a delightful
      herbal fragrance with every bite.
    </p>
    <p class="food-description">
      Drizzles of extra-virgin olive oil lend a subtle richness, enhancing the
      flavors and ensuring a luscious finish. The pizza emerges from the oven
      with its crust crisp and blistered, the cheese molten and bubbly, and the
      basil leaves gently wilted, creating an irresistible aroma that tantalizes
      the senses.
    </p>
    <p class="food-description">
      A Margherita pizza is not just a dish; it's a celebration of simplicity
      and quality. Each bite is a symphony of flavors—a harmony of tangy
      tomatoes, creamy cheese, aromatic basil, and the earthy notes of olive
      oil—all coming together to create a culinary masterpiece that stands the
      test of time.

    <h3>Preparation & Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span class="recipe-li-bold"><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong></span>
        If making your own dough, follow your favorite pizza dough recipe or use
        a store-bought dough. Let it sit at room temperature for about 30
        minutes to an hour before rolling it out.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <span class="recipe-li-bold"><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong></span>
        Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can reach, usually
        around 500°F (260°C). Place a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven to
        heat.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <span class="recipe-li-bold"><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong></span>
        On a floured surface or parchment paper, roll or stretch the dough into
        a round shape, ensuring it's not too thick. Transfer it onto parchment
        paper for easy transfer to the oven.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <span class="recipe-li-bold"><strong>Prepare the Pizza:</strong></span>
        Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes evenly over the
        dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <span class="recipe-li-bold"><strong>Add the Cheese:</strong></span>
        Tear or slice the fresh mozzarella and distribute it evenly over the
        sauce.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <span class="recipe-li-bold"><strong>Top with Basil:</strong></span>
        Place fresh basil leaves on top of the cheese. You can leave them whole
        or tear them gently.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <span class="recipe-li-bold"
          ><strong>Drizzle with Olive Oil:</strong></span
        >
        Lightly drizzle extra-virgin olive oil over the pizza. Season with a
        pinch of salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <span class="recipe-li-bold"><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong></span>
        Carefully transfer the pizza (on the parchment paper) onto the preheated
        pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <span class="recipe-li-bold"
          ><strong>Bake Until Golden and Bubbly:</strong></span
        >
        Bake for about 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden brown, the
        cheese is melted and bubbly, and the edges are crisp.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <span class="recipe-li-bold"><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong></span>
        Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute before
        slicing. Serve your Margherita pizza hot and enjoy the wonderful flavors
        of the fresh ingredients.
