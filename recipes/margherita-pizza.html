  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    The Margherita pizza is a culinary masterpiece that epitomizes simplicity
    and elegance in Italian cuisine. At its core, it celebrates the harmony of
    just a few fresh and high-quality ingredients.
  </p>
  <p>
    The foundation is a perfectly baked crust—thin, yet with a satisfyingly
    chewy texture. This canvas is adorned with vibrant, sun-ripened tomatoes or
    a simple tomato sauce, delivering a burst of fresh flavor. The tomatoes are
    spread thinly to maintain the pizza's balance, allowing their natural
    sweetness to shine through.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next comes the creamy, milky richness of fresh mozzarella cheese, carefully
    arranged in soft, melting dollops or slices across the surface. The cheese
    melds beautifully with the tomatoes, providing a delicate contrast to their
    acidity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Completing this culinary artwork are bright green basil leaves, arranged
    atop the cheese. The basil not only adds a visual pop of color but also
    infuses the pizza with its aromatic freshness, releasing a delightful herbal
    fragrance with every bite.
  </p>
  <p>
    Drizzles of extra-virgin olive oil lend a subtle richness, enhancing the
    flavors and ensuring a luscious finish. The pizza emerges from the oven with
    its crust crisp and blistered, the cheese molten and bubbly, and the basil
    leaves gently wilted, creating an irresistible aroma that tantalizes the
    senses.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Margherita pizza is not just a dish; it's a celebration of simplicity and
    quality. Each bite is a symphony of flavors—a harmony of tangy tomatoes,
    creamy cheese, aromatic basil, and the earthy notes of olive oil—all coming
    together to create a culinary masterpiece that stands the test of time.

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pizza Dough</li>
    <li>Tomato Sauce or Crushed Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Fresh Mozzarella Cheese</li>
    <li>Fresh Basil Leaves</li>
    <li>Extra-Virgin Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Preparation & Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> If making your own dough, follow your
      favorite pizza dough recipe or use a store-bought dough. Let it sit at
      room temperature for about 30 minutes to an hour before rolling it out.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to the highest
      temperature it can reach, usually around 500°F (260°C). Place a pizza
      stone or baking sheet in the oven to heat.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> On a floured surface or parchment
      paper, roll or stretch the dough into a round shape, ensuring it's not too
      thick. Transfer it onto parchment paper for easy transfer to the oven.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>Prepare the Pizza:</strong> Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce or
      crushed tomatoes evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the
      edges.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>Add the Cheese:</strong> Tear or slice the fresh mozzarella and
      distribute it evenly over the sauce.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>Top with Basil:</strong> Place fresh basil leaves on top of the
      cheese. You can leave them whole or tear them gently.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>Drizzle with Olive Oil:</strong> Lightly drizzle extra-virgin
      olive oil over the pizza. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to taste.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong> Carefully transfer the pizza (on the
      parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the
      oven.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>Bake Until Golden and Bubbly:</strong> Bake for about 10-12
      minutes or until the crust is golden brown, the cheese is melted and
      bubbly, and the edges are crisp.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Remove the pizza from the oven and let
      it cool for a minute before slicing. Serve your Margherita pizza hot and
      enjoy the wonderful flavors of the fresh ingredients.
